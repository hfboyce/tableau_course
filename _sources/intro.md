# Learning Data Visualization with Tableau 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, learners are expected to be able to:

1. Distinguish between good visualizations vs bad visualizations.
2. Explain how visualizations are important to the data analysis process. 
3. Conduct full exploratory data analysis including visualizations. 
4. Use appropriate plots and graphs to effectively communicate insights from the data with a specified audience.
5. Create a compelling narrative for your findings using storytelling.
6. Connect Tableau to different data sources.
7. Construct maps, distributions, bar and line plots using Tableau.
8. Identify the different data fields and data types used by Tableau and when to appropriately apply them to different columns.
