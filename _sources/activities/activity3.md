## Exercise 4: Creating Dashboards  

1\. Create a new Dashboard page.
2\. Convert Dashboard **Size** to automatic.     
3\. From the google drive, download this       [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10JhxST9v0axsBmKJ4ZR64lVicv8XQyTN/view?usp=sharing) and add it to your dashboard. I recommend to"fit the image"" to the outline.   
4\. Add the scatterplot,the heatmap and both of the histograms to your dashboard.
5\. Create a sex filters for the scatterplot that is in the style of dropdown and you can select multiple categories.       
- Adjust this filter so it works for all the plots.     
6. Create a bodymass filter, that only works on the 2 histograms. 

7\. Create a text box with your Dashboard title and have it "Float" over the image.
