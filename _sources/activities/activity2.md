#  Lesson 2: Plots and Dashboards 

This exercise will require you to use the data named [penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data?select=penguins_lter.csv) that you can find on the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KHqO4AEbNmpudl0oW4MCgzYexTZO3MJ/view?usp=sharing). 


## Exercise 1: Loading in the data

1. Load in the `penguin.csv` data. 
- How many geographical columns are there?
- How many Measures are there?
- How many continuous columns?
- Are any columns generated by Tableau?
- Are there any date fields?
  
Note: There are no "unique" Identifying columns in this dataframe, so when we are using the **count** statistic you can use the **Count** (Not Count distinct) measure of the column you can assess.  

## Exercise 2: Basic plots

1. Are there any columns that would be appropriate for a pie chart? 
2. Create a new worksheet and create a Stacked bar chart from the `Species` column. 
3. Is it easy to see the quantity value of each of the penguin species?
4. Convert the stacked bar plot into a side-by-side bar plot. 
- Sort the bars in descending order 
- Add a colour to each species if you want to. 
4. Open a new worksheet and create a scatterplot between the `Body Mass (g)` and `flipper Length` fields. 
- Change the mark style to a circle and decrease the point size. 
- Add the species field to the colour channel.
- What kind of relationship did you identify? 
- Which penguin species tend to have the greatest flipper length?
5. Create a line graph that shows the number of egg clutches over the research period.
- Does the field appear to have a cyclical component? If so, how long is 1 cycle approximately? 



## Exercise 3: Creating Distributions 
1. Create a histogram for the `Culmen Length (mm)` field.
- Change the size of the bins to 1.
- What type of shape does it have? (uniform, bell?)
- How many "peaks" does it have? 
- Add the species dimension to either the **Columns** shelf or the colour channel. Which species tends to have the shortest culmen lengths? 
  
2. Create a histogram for the `Culmen Depth (mm)` column now. 
- Change the size of the bins to 0.5  now. 
- What is the range of values?
- Add the species dimension to either the **Columns** shelf or the colour channel. Which species tends to have the most shallow culmens? 
  
3. Now let's try and compare the bodyweight distributions between the penguin sexes using a box plot. Exclude the observation that has an unmarked value by right-clicking it and selecting **Hide**. 
- Are there any outliers displayed as marks on the boxplots? 
- Sort the boxplots in descending order by the median. 
- Which sex has the higher median body mass?

4. Create a new worksheet and let's create a heatmap between the `Island` and `Species` columns. 
- Which island has only 1 species inhabiting it?
- Which species is only inhabiting on a single island?
- Add the count of the penguins as a label to each mark.
- How many Gentoo penguins are on Biscoe island? 



## Exercise 4: Creating Dashboards  

1. Convert Dashboard **Size** to automatic.
2. From the google drive, download this [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10JhxST9v0axsBmKJ4ZR64lVicv8XQyTN/view?usp=sharing) and add it to your dashboard. 
3. Create a Text box with your Dashboard title and have it "Float" over the image. 

<!--
4. Add sheets
5. Create filters for col1 col2 col3 
- Change the filter style for  ... to ....
6. Filter for all sheets
7. Make the heatmap a filter
