#  Lesson 2: Plots and Dashboards 

This exercise will required you to use the data named [penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data?select=penguins_lter.csv) that you can find on the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-KHqO4AEbNmpudl0oW4MCgzYexTZO3MJ/view?usp=sharing). 


## Exercise 1: Loading in the data

1. Load in the `penguin.csv` data. 
  - How many geographical columns are there?
  - How many Measures are there?
  - How many continuous columns?
  - Are any columns generated by Tableau?
  - Are there any date fields?
  
Note: There are no "unique" Identifying columns in this dataframe, so when we are using the **count** statistic you can use the **Count** (Not Count distinct) measure of the column you can assessing.  

## Exercise 2: Basic plots

1. Are there any columns that would be appropriate for a pie chart? 
2. Create a new worksheet and create a Stacked bar chart from the `Species` column. 
3. Is it easy to see the quantity value of each of the penguin species?
4. Convert the stacked bar plot into a side-by-side bar plot. 
  - Sort the bars in descending order 
  - Add a colour to each species if you want to. 
3. Open a new worksheet and create a scatterplot between the `Body Mass (g)` and `flipper Length` fields. 
  - Change the mark style to a circle and decrease the point size. 
  - Add the species field to the colour channel.
  - What kind of relationship did you identify? 
  - Which penguin species tend to have the greatest flipper length?
4. Create a line graph that shows the number of egg clutches over the research period.
  - Does the field appear to have a cyclical component? If so, how long is 1 cycle approximately? 



## Exercise 3: Creating Distributions 
1. Histogram
2. boxplot
3. heatmap
4. Which ....


## Exercise 4: Creating Dashboards  

1. Convert Dashboard **Size** to automatic
2. From the google drive, download this [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10JhxST9v0axsBmKJ4ZR64lVicv8XQyTN/view?usp=sharing) and add it to your dashboard. 
3. Create a Text box with your Dashboard title and have it "Float" over the image. 
-------
4. Add sheets
5. Create filters for col1 col2 col3 
- Change the filter style for  ... to ....
6. Filter for all sheets
7. Make the heatmap a filter
