#  Visualization Types 

## Introduction 

In the theory portion of lesson 2, we're going to discuss the different types of visualizations possible and when/how they are used to communicate the data to an audience. 

There are MANY different graphs and unfortunately, we are only going to scrape a small surface. 

A great resource to use to discover different visualization types is [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/). Now, remember that just because the viz type exists, doesn't necessarily mean it's the most effective plot for communication. 

## Graph Types 

### Area vs Position

First, let's get into channel types. When we make plots we often use either an area or a position channel to represent data. Let's compare how these two channels can impact the efficiency of our interpretation of plots.  

This exercise was replicated from the [Data Visualization](https://viz-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en/module2) course I co-created with [Joel Ostblom](https://joelostblom.com/) where we adapted the examples given from [Jeffrey Heerâ€™s PyData talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsfWtPH2kDg). 

First, try to estimate how many times larger circle B is compared to circle A.


<img src="imgs/circles1.png"  width = "60%" alt="404 image" />


<br>
<br>


Not exactly easy is it? Let's try it with bars now. 

How many times *longer* is bar B than bar A?

<img src="imgs/bars1.png"  width = "25%" alt="404 image" />


<br>
<br>

Well, the answer is the same in both examples the bar B is 8 times longer than bar A and circle B is 8 times larger than the area of circle A. 

Even if you were right with both of these estimates, you would have likely found it easier to compare the length of the bars over the area of the circles. The other question that may come to mind is are you supposed to compare diameter, radius, or area? 

With bars, so long are the widths are the same the ambiguity is lower for comparing objects. 

This is something that really should be on your mind when using visualizations to communicate insights.  

### Pie Charts 

A pie chart is a circular graph (a pie ðŸ¥§ if you will) that is broken into slices to illustrate the numerical proportion of a whole.

In pie charts, the arc length, angle and area of each slice are proportional to the value it's representing.


<img src="imgs/pies.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" />


Pie charts generally work well when the values are easy fractions like a half or quarter or when the datasets are small but this figure has a bad reputation in data science and is often criticized by experts.  

This communication of information can instead be displayed with either a stacked bar chart or side-by-side bar charts. 


### Stacked Bar Charts 

Stacked bar charts communicate the same information as a pie chart however often it is argued that this is easier to compare values. 

Often stacked bar charts are ideal when there are only two categories since both segments will be easy to compare between categories.


<img src="imgs/stacked.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" />


### Side by Side Bars

The last option is if we simply displayed the information using position only and split up the categories into separate bars. 


<img src="imgs/sidebars.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" />


Here we can see not only the values of each category quickly and clearly but we don't have to do any hard approximation of how many times larger one category is from another. 



### Comparing Pie, Stacked Bar and Side by Side Bar Plots 

Clause Wike has the following useful table from his [Data Viz](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-proportions.html#a-case-for-pie-charts) resource that explains how the 3 types of plots can most effectively be used.

</table>

My simple rule of thumb is when possible use side-by-side plots unless there are 2 categories where you want a quick identification of when a category is greater.

### 3-D

Ahhhh, The 3D plot. We mentioned this very quickly on the very first day of our course and we saw how changing the dimension of a plot visualizing the ESS of blood vessels increased the identification of low ESS from 71% to 91%. 

<img src="imgs/heart2.png"  width = "50%" alt="404 image" /><img src="imgs/heart3.png"  width = "50%" alt="404 image" />

This alone should be enough of an argument to explain why 3D plots should not be used unnecessarily.

The most common time to avoid 3-dimensional plots is in a bar or pie chart or when you have no way of rotating your plot to see all the views possible. 

Let's look at a clear example where this method is deceiving. 

<img src="imgs/bad-3d-barchart.png"  width = "70%" alt="404 image" />

[Source: Joel Ostblom](https://viz-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en/module2)

The values of each of these bars appear to have the values  A=0.7, B=1.7, C=2.7 and D=3.7.

However, in reality, the true values of A, B, C and D are 1,2,3, and 4 and it's only because of the angle and point of view of the plot, do we see deceiving values. 

This being said, 3D plots can be extremely communicative in animative plots or in topographical maps or when you have control over the view. 

### Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is a type of plot used to visualize 2 columns that both have continuous values.  

<img src="imgs/scatter1.png"  width = "50%" alt="404 image" />

Scatter plots are also used to observe relationships between variables.
For example, if when the values of x increases, the y values tend to increase, there appears to be a positive relationship between the 2 columns. 

<img src="https://www.emathzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/scatter-diagram.jpg"  width = "60%" alt="404 image" />
<br>
[Source: www.emathzone.com](https://www.emathzone.com/tutorials/basic-statistics/scatter-diagram.html)


You'll likely be using these frequently as they are easy to interpret and they also can show the distribution of 2 columns simultaneously. (We will talk a little more about this later.)


### Line Graphs

You'll often see these when trying to visualize time as a variable. Time is a continuous feature usually plotted on the x-axis.

Data is plotted and a line is created to connect the data between intervals. 


<img src="imgs/line1.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />


Line graphs are quite common in the wild because they are easy to understand.

Rarely, (if ever) will you see line graphs visualizing categorical data. 

Don't mistake line graphs with lines of best fit or trend lines. These are quite different. 


<img src="imgs/trend1.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

A trend line won't connect the data points and instead will find a suitable equation for a line that approximately represents the data as a straight line, whereas line graphs connect the data together. 

### Geographical 

When displaying data with a geospatial component we generally need to use some form of a map. We saw already that Tableau takes coordinates such as latitude and longitude and projects them onto a flat surface. 

<img src="imgs/geospace1.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

We also often colour different regions based on specific data values. These are called **Choropleth maps**. We will learn how to make these in Lesson 3.

## Distributions 

Often when we are trying to understand our data better, we dive deeper into particular columns and examine how frequently certain values occur, or the range it spans over. 

Visualizing the distribution of these columns allows us to identify both of these measures. 

### Visualizing a Numeric Column

The simplest way to see how a column from a dataframe is distributed is by plotting all the values on a single axis. 

This is like a single axis of a scatter plot. 

<img src="imgs/dist1.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Now, this looks fine with a few values but what happens when we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of rows?

<img src="imgs/dist2.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

It's now extremely difficult to make sense of the distribution as the points are all overlapping. 

We call this type of behaviour in plots "over-saturated".

So, what can we use instead? 

#### Histograms 

We can instead group the values into bins and show the number of observations in each bin (the count) on the y-axis. 

This ends up looking like a bar chart but instead of a categorical column on one of the axis, we have displayed our continuous, numeric column into groups. 

<img src="imgs/hist1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This distribution could be potentially changed with different axis transformations but we can talk about that later on.

Some distributions have a bell shape distribution which we call "normal". Others can have many peaks or no peaks at all which we would call "uniform".

#### Density 

One of the problems with histograms is that we can vary the shape of the distribution depending on the width we assign to each bin. For example, the bins could be \$100 wide or \$500 wide and our distribution would then change.


<img src="imgs/hist2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

A histogram is not completely unbiased and when we have a small dataset, this can be much more problematic.

We often use histograms because they have been used for centuries now and easy to draw without too many problems. 

With our new age of technology though, we can use other plotting types that have less bias. 

The density plot is a solution to this!


<img src="https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing_distributions_I_files/figure-html/titanic-ages-dens1-1.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />


Density plots visualize uses **kernel smoothing** to visualize the underlying probability distribution of the data.

Essentially we can create bell-shaped bins for the data instead of square ones in the histograms. These bell-shaped bins are called kernels and added up together to give a smooth distribution. 



Although we often call this a "density plot", the proper name is **Kernel Density Estimate** (KDE).

The funny thing about everything we said above is that Tableau does not facilitate the creation of density plots easily. Of course, there are workarounds for this but we have histograms to work with instead. 


### Visualizing 2 numeric columns 

If we want to compare the distributions of 2 numeric columns, the easiest plot to create would simply be a scatter plot! 


<img src="imgs/scatter2.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />


We can also see the relationship between the two columns, the frequency of the values of each axis, as well as the range. 


### Visualizing the Distribution of Categorical Columns

We've seen that bar charts work as a method of displaying the number of observations for each category in a categorical column which is somewhat like a distribution but is most commonly referred to as just showing the counts of the categories. 


<img src="imgs/boxplot0.png"  width = "20%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

However, this only shows a single value for each category though whether it be the count, mean, median, etc. and we know that can be quite restrictive. It will hide a lot of the variation that may be occurring in the data and potentially lead to incorrect analysis. 

So, what can we use instead? 

#### Box Plot 

A boxplot is a graph that shows some key summary statistics and often outlying individual values.

<img src="imgs/boxplot1.png"  width = "20%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Box plots will show not just the median value, but also the lower and upper quartiles, and often the min and max values or extreme values. 

<img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/box_plot.png"  width = "55%" alt="404 image" />

[Source: https://datavizcatalogue.com](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/box_plot.png)
<br>
<br>

- The middle line represents the data's median value. 
- The box is the data's interquartile range (IQR) which is the 25th to the 75th percentile.
- The **whiskers** often indicates the variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.
- Sometimes outliers are displayed as individual marks. 



#### Violin plot 

Although Tableau isn't capable of making violin plots in an easy straightforward way, it's important that we mention them. 

<img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/SVG/violin_plot.svg"  width = "90%" alt="404 image" />

[Source: https://datavizcatalogue.com](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/top_images/SVG/violin_plot.svg)
<br>
<br>

Boxplots are effective for showing multiple statistics, however, they are not effective in showing distributions with multiple peaks. 

<img src="https://d2f99xq7vri1nk.cloudfront.net/BoxViolinSmaller.gif"  width = "95%" alt="404 image" />

[Source: Justin Matejka, George Fitzmaurice](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)
<br>
<br>

Violin plots essentially give us a rotated distribution of the data and help us interpret the data more effectively than a box plot. 


### Visualizing the distribution of 2 Categoric Columns 

Often we may want to see the number of observations that are in 2 specific columns. 

For example, if a movie genre is contained in 1 column, and the rating is a second column, how many movies in our data are of the "Action" genre and are rated 13A? 

You often will have questions that are dependent on knowing how many observations are present in 2 different column categories. 

#### Heatmaps

Heatmaps are a way to effectively visualize the counts of observations from two-dimensional categorical data.


<img src="imgs/heatmap1.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


In this heatmap, we can see that the consumer segment ships the majority of their orders with Standard Class. In fact, for all segments, Standard Class appears to be the most frequent. 

We can really get a sense of our data when comparing 2 categorical columns, and heatmaps are an effective way to do so, however, they do not give the exact count for each colour tint so adjusting the plot accordingly could sometimes be helpful in some scenarios. 


<img src="imgs/heatmap2.png"  width = "75%" alt="404 image" />

#### Plots Using Marker Size 

We talked about how relying on a single colour channel to communicate information can pose some problems for those with colorblindness and it's often harder to see small variations in colour as we can with position or size channels. 

To accommodate for these issues, we can either add the values as we showed above or we can use size **AND** colour for these plots.
