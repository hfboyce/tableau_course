# Dashboards, EDA and Choropleths

## Dashboards

The moment we've all been waiting for! This is where we can take our visualizations from our worksheets, combine them into 1 page (or multiple) and add filters making them dynamic in nature. 

Let's begin by creating a new Dashboard. 

1\. Click on the Dashboard icon at the bottom of your workspace. 

<img src="imgs/dash0.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/dash00.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Here we can display images, worksheets, filters and even website pages. 

### Workspace 

Here we can examine the buttons are tools we will need to create our dashboards. 

<img src="imgs/dash_workspace.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size:30px; color:#FFF995">Size</p>

It's important that you select the size of the screen your dashboard is expected to be displayed on. 
The [options](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm) are:

- Fixed: The dashboard remains the same size no matter the screen used to display it. If the dashboard is bigger than the designated window, the dashboard will be scrollable. 
- Range: The dashboard scales between a minimum and a maximum size that you specify.
- **Automatic** - This is what I generally suggest since the dashboard will automatically resize to fit the screen it's displayed on. When using Automatic I also firmly suggest using a **Tiled** dashboard layout (explained below). 

<img src="imgs/dash_size1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/dash_size2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size:30px; color:#73FCD6">Sheets</p>

Here is where we can select the plots we made on the worksheets and bring them together collectively on a dashboard. 

All we have to do is drag the sheet to the visualization space. 

<img src="imgs/dash_sheet1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/dash_sheet2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size:30px; color:#76D6FF">Tiled/Floating</p>

#### Tiled example 

You'll notice that when we dragged these sheets they snapped into a position. This is creating tiles. I only recommend using this layout method when using the Automatic sizing option. 


<img src="imgs/tiled.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


```{admonition} Tip!
:class: tip
When you drag sheets into the Dashboard, you can have them displayed in the standard view, or if you want the visualization to take up more space in the boundaries, you can:

1\. Click on the desired plot.     
2\. Select the **More Options** icon.      
3\. Under the **Fit** option, you can select "**Entire View**"      

<img src="imgs/fit_bar.png"  width = "35%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

And we can see the difference using our boxplot as an example.

<img src="imgs/fit.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />  


```

#### Floating example 

If we instead used the floating option, we could place the plot anywhere but it can prove problematic when the screen size is fixed. 

<img src="imgs/floating.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size:30px; color:#FF85FF">Objects</p>

We are not restricted to only putting worksheets and graphs on our dashboard. We can also add images, webpages embedded in the sheets as well as Text boxes, downloading and navigation button options.

#### images

We can place images in our dashboards just as easily as we can sheets. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. We first drag the **Image** option where we wish to place it in the dashboard. 

<img src="imgs/image1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. We then must select our desired images from our file directory, here I'm using the `trees.png` file which I've also made available on my Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IP1Vs8bJnGElKfqZ8VkNlLVX-VXJZfaVhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IP1Vs8bJnGElKfqZ8VkNlLVX-VXJZfaV).

<img src="imgs/image2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


3\. I select the **Fit Image** option so that the image is fixed to the dimension of the dashboard tile. 
<img src="imgs/image3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

And there you have it! 
<img src="imgs/image4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>



#### webpage

We can even embed complete working websites in our dashboards. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. We drag the **Web Page** option to the dashboard and it will result in a popup asking for the desired page. 

<img src="imgs/object2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

And it's as simple as that! We have the website active now! 

<img src="imgs/object3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


#### Text

Adding text for titles or explanations (I've even added axis titles using this option when in a pinch) works the same as images and webpages. We can drag and then format our text. 

<img src="imgs/object5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/object6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />


#### Download

To create an option to download a static copy of your dashboard, you can add a button allowing the viewer to do so. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. Like the other object, we drag the **Download** icon to the dashboard.
<img src="imgs/object7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. To format it, we need to double click and select the desired export or button type and format the font. 
<img src="imgs/object8.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />


3\. We can also adjust the background colour.

<img src="imgs/object9.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/object10.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />


#### Navigation

There may be times where on your dashboard you'd like to navigate to either a different dashboard or perhaps dive deeper into a worksheet. I needed this for my own dashboards when I had the list of customers pop up with certain filters and I wanted to navigate back to the main dashboard. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\.This can be down by dragging the **Navigation** icon onto the dashboard.
<img src="imgs/object11.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. We don't need to do this for our dashboard, but you can then select where this button will navigate you to. 

<img src="imgs/object12.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />



#### Extensions 

For certain additional actions and features, we can also add extensions that other people have made and shared publicly. 

We will discuss this in the 4th lesson if we have time. 


<p style="font-size:30px; color:#9437FF">Device Preview</p>


You can check and preview what your dashboard will look for other devices by clicking this **Device Preview** and scrolling through the options like **Desktop**, **Tablet** and **Phone**

<img src="imgs/preview1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/preview2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/preview3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />


### Filtering 

Here is where the fun starts! Since Tableau is an excellent tool to use for dynamic plots, let's go ahead and see why first hand. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. Click on the sheet you wish to filter. On the right side of the plot, you'll see a **More Options** button. 

<img src="imgs/filter2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will produce a dropdown where we want to select a field to filter on. Under **Filters** we can then select the columns displayed. These are currently the ones we are using in the plot already. We will show you how to filter on additional columns momentarily. For now, let's select  `Diameter`.

<img src="imgs/filter3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. Selecting the field desired will then produce a filter! 

<img src="imgs/filter4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>




3\. Let's add another. Let's add the `Height Range Id` as a filter too.

<img src="imgs/filter6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/filter7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

I'm going to move the plot so that we can focus on the filters and see all the popups here.

<img src="imgs/filter8.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


4\. If we click on the filter we can then see a **More Options** icon. 

<img src="imgs/filter9.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

This is where we can see all the filter style options. 


<img src="imgs/filter10.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

Since both of these fields as measures, we can filter in the following ways: 

- **Range of Values/Dates:** This means you can filter the data to include or exclude more values. You can pick the minimum and maximum values. 

- **At Least/Starting Date:** This has a fixed maximum value and an open-ended minimum value that the user chooses.

- **At Most/Ending Date:** This has a fixed minimum value with an open-ended maximum value that the user chooses.

For periods there, there are 2 more called **Relative to Now** and **Browse periods** where the values must be continuous. 



5\. In order to filter the graphs by other columns, we must add it to the **Filters** card on the Worksheet page of the plot. 

Locate yourself to the appropriate sheet using the tab at the bottom. Select the column you wish to filter the plot on and drag it to the **Filters** card. Here we are going to drag the **Neighbourhood Name** column. 

<img src="imgs/filter0.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will create a pop-up where we can select the categories and values we wish to include. I will be selecting **All**

<img src="imgs/filter11.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/filter12.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

6\. We can then return to our dashboard, click on the plot and see that `Neighbourhood Name` has need added to the choice of filters. 

<img src="imgs/filter14.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This produces a list of all the neighbourhoods now. 
<img src="imgs/filter00.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


7\. Clicking on this filter and selecting the **More Option** icon, you'll see all the different filtering styles.

<img src="imgs/filter15.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

`Neighbourhood Name` is a Dimension. Dimensions have the following possible filtering styles ([Source: help.tableau.com](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/filtering.htm)): 

- **Single Value (List):** A full list of all the possible values of the filter as radio buttons but only 1 can be selected at a time.

- **Multiple Values (List):** Shows all the values in the filter as a list of checkboxes where multiple values can be selected.

- **Single Value (Dropdown):** Displays the values of the filter in a drop-down list where only a single value can be selected at a time.

- **Multiple Values(Dropdown):** Displays the values of the filter in a drop-down list where multiple values can be selected.

- **Single Value (Slider):** Displays the values of the filter along a slider. Only a single value can be selected at a time. This option is useful for dimensions that have an implicit order such as dates.

- **Multiple Values (Custom List):** Displays a text box where you can type a few characters and search for the value. 

- **Wildcard Match:** Displays a text box where you can type a few characters. All values that match those characters are automatically selected. 
 

We are going to select the Multiple Values Dropdown


<img src="imgs/filter16.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


### Filter All Sheets using Same Data Source

One of the great things about Tableau is now we can take the filter we made for one of our plots and use it for some of the other plots in our dashboard. 

If we are using multiple sources that share columns, we can program our filter so that it's applied to multiple worksheets. 

Selecting **All using Related Data Sources** and now all the plots that have this field name will work with it. 

In our case, we can use the **All Using this Data Source** option which will now filter all the worksheets using the `street-trees.csv`  data file. 

This is done by clicking the desired filter, and selecting the **More options** icon. 

Under the dropdown menu, we can **Apply to Worksheets** and select **All Using this Data Source**.


<img src="imgs/filterx2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Now when we use this filter and select no neighbourhoods (None), none of our graphs show up! This filter is now working for all our graphs.

<img src="imgs/filterx3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


If we change the filter to **Kitsilano**, all our graphs are filtered accordingly now! 

<img src="imgs/filterx4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


If we only wanted this filter to only affect a few of the graphs, we can select the **Selected Worksheets** and then chose the worksheets we wish to depend on the filter. 


<img src="imgs/filterx9.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


<img src="imgs/filterx8.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


### Plots as Filters 

Tableau also gives the option of using a graph itself as a filter. Here we will use our boxplot as a filter for the other two. 

We can do this in 2 ways. 

1. By using the funnel icon when we click the plot

2. Selecting it from the **More Options** menu. 


<img src="imgs/filterx6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Now when we click on the Boxplot with `Root Barrier = Y`, our plots filter accordingly. 

<img src="imgs/filterx7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

## Publishing Dashboards 

You can either publish your dashboard on your company's Tableau server or using Tableau online. 

I don't have access to either of these so it makes it difficult to demonstrate this to you. 

I can link you to [this easy to follow step-by-step guide](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_share.htm) that walks you through the steps to publish your work. 

You'll also be able to publish your work on [Tableau Public](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_tableaupublic.htm) (If the data you are using is not sensitive and you are allowed to do so) which is where we saw some of the other dashboard examples. 

*Note that publishing to Tableau public is only recommended for personal projects using open source data.* 


## Quick Quiz

1. **True or False:** Dimensions have more filtering style options than Measures. 
2. If we want to filter on a field/column that isn't used in the plot where must we make this adjustment, on the dashboard or on the plot's corresponding worksheet? 
3. Which of the following is not an option for Device Preview: Phone, Desktop, Embedded webpage, Tablet. 
4. Which of the following file type is not an option to export your dashboard as with a **Download** object; PowerPoint, Crosstab, image, Word document? 
5. Which layout type is recommended when choosing **Automatic** as a Dashboard size?
6. **True or False:** You can only have 1 dashboard tab for each file. 

<!--

## EDA 

Exploring your data in Tableau is not quite as intuitive as hoped and it's likely better to use Tableau Prep for this. 

### Tableau Prep

Tableau Prep is not covered in this curriculum but I'm going to give you a tiny tiny demo and some minimal notes and screenshots that should help with EDA. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. Open Tableau Prep. When the application open's you should be greeted to this home screen. 

<img src="imgs/tableauprep1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


2\. Click on the **Connect to Data** button at the top of your screen.  

<img src="imgs/tableauprep2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


3\. Select the appropriate data source. For any `.csv` files, connect using **Text file**. Since we are connecting to `street-trees.csv`, we will be using that option. 

<img src="imgs/tableauprep4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Once you select your appropriate file in your document, Tableau Prep will bring in your data. 

<img src="imgs/tableauprep5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

You should be able to see all the column names and some sample values that are contained in each. 

4\. Click on the ⊕ icon on the right of the data source. 

<img src="imgs/tableauprep6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

5\. This will produce a drop-down menu where you'll want to **+ Add Step**

<img src="imgs/tableauprep7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

6\. Tableau Prep will then automatically create distributions for each column in your data. 

<img src="imgs/tableauprep8.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<img src="imgs/tableauprep9.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


Tableau Prep can then be used to create new columns, and delete observations. Deleting observations cannot "per say" be done in Tableau but we can exclude them and/or filter them. 

I can also direct you to [this wonderful article by Sergei Medvedev](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-with-tableau-for-classification-problems-9dea20ab8c01) which gives some straightforward instructions on how Tableau Prep can be used for EDA. 

In addition, [tableau.com](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/data-prep-best-practices) also is a great resource, specifically [this article](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/data-prep-best-practices) which teaches you how to clean your data including how to rename values.

### Describe 

Tableau Desktop does offer another small method to learn a little bit about your data. 

If you locate yourself to the **Data Source**, you'll be able to minimally explore your column fields. 


<img src="imgs/describe1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Here let's look at a column that is a discrete Dimension - in our case `Genus Name`. Click to obtain the dropdown menu and select **Describe...**. 

<img src="imgs/describe2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will give a little information about the column including if any null values are present. It will also tell you all the possible unique values the column has.

<img src="imgs/describe3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Let's try it now for a continuous Measure - `Diameter`. Bring the dropdown menu up by clicking and then again select **Describe...**. 


<img src="imgs/describe5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Here you may need to load the domain. 
<img src="imgs/describe6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

After loading it will give you the maximum and minimum values of the columns. 
<img src="imgs/describe7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

### Pages

Pages are useful when you want to get many plots for multiple categories in a field. 

We could either use a colour field... 

So, for example let's take our line plot which shows the number of trees planted each year. Let's see this for each tree genus now. 

<img src="imgs/pages1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

If we drag `Genus Name` to the colour channel, we get an expected warning telling us they only recommend fields with up to 20 unique values, but we have 97! 

<img src="imgs/pages2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

If we agree to it, our final plot is... well messy, confusing and just hard to read. 


A better solution would be to make a plot for each Genus type. Now instead of *actually* making a plot for every single categorical value (since we are lazy after all), we can use the *Pages* card.   

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. Let's start with our line plot as a base (a continuous `YEAR(Date Planted)` Measure and `CNT(Tree Id)` on the Columns and Rows shelves respectively).

<img src="imgs/pages1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2.\ All you need to do is drag your desired field to the **Pages** card. 

<img src="imgs/pages4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Tableau explains pages as a "shelf [that] lets you break a view into a series of pages so you can better analyze how a specific field affects the rest of the data in a view".

Now we can scroll through all the trees genus and see the respective line graph for each without having to make all 97 of them! 


<img src="imgs/pages5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


You can either select specific category names with the dropdown...


<img src="imgs/pages6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


... scroll through all the categories... 

<img src="imgs/pages8.png"  width = "35%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


...or use the controls to watch a slide show of all the plots.


<img src="imgs/pages7.png"  width = "35%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

```{Note} Tip!
:class: tip
The icons on the right indicate how fast to transition to the next category's plot. 
1 bar being the slowest and 3 bars being the fastest. 
```


If we wanted all the plots together, we could have dragged `Genus Name` to the **Rows** Shelf.

<img src="imgs/facet.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>



This is called **Faceting**. 



## Quick Additions - Lines and predictions

Tableau is quick convenient and one of the luxuries it provides is that it gives us the ability to add additional information to our plots in some form of line or curve.

Lines can be added to plots to highlight a specific trend your data might be showing. 

To get to this area, click on the Analytics tab in the left toolbar. 

<img src="imgs/lines1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


There are many different kinds of lines you can add...

<img src="imgs/lines2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

###  Summary Lines 

Summarize lines: They can either show a summary statistic line or constant value for either the x or the y axis. 

<img src="imgs/lines3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

just drag and drop to the correct line you wish to add. 

The drop area will specify if you want to add it to the specific field ( x-axis or y-axis). 

<img src="imgs/lines4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


### Trend lines

Trend lines will add a line of best fit to your plot. You can choose between Linear, Logarithmic, Exponential, Polynomial, or Power model types. 

See [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/trendlines_add.htm#modeltype) for more information on how these are decided. 

Again, all you need to do is select the **Trend Line** option and drag it to the visualization area. 

<img src="imgs/lines5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

You can select one of the options you think suits your data best and it will display it on your plot.  

<img src="imgs/lines6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

If you click or hover over the line, it will give you more information on how it was calculated. 

<img src="imgs/lines7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


### Forecasting

```{Warning} 
Forecasting is a bit more difficult to use and I say this because we don't know as well what is happening behind the calculations. I don't usually suggest using this feature as it's not quite as reliable as other forecasting models where you have much more control and transparency, and much fewer restrictions.

That being said, they can be helpful in a pinch for some rough calculations if needed. 
```

Forecasting definitely should be used if you have a bit more knowledge as you will need to know how you wish your trend and seasonality to be predicted - in an additive or multiplicative manner. 

Let's say we wanted to predict how many trees will be planted in 2020 (I realize it's past 2020 so let's instead predict how many trees would have been planted in the 2020 dataset).

<img src="imgs/forecast1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. From the left side of the Analytics tab, drag the **Forecast** option into the visualization view, you will then be prompted to select **Forecast**. 

<img src="imgs/forecast2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will automatically change the colour of your plot and you'll see 2 colours, one for the actual values and one for the estimate.

<img src="imgs/forecast3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

If you hover over 2020, you can now see that the model predicts 1094 trees planted. 

<img src="imgs/forecast4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. You can right-click and under the **Forecast** option we can click **Forecast Options...** to edit this option. 

<img src="imgs/forecast5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

3\. We can predict in different ways and aggregate by years, quarters, months, etc. 

<img src="imgs/forecast6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

4\. Under **Forecast Model** we can select **Custom**.

<img src="imgs/forecast7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>

5\. This will prompt the different ways you can predict the trend and seasonality of the model - Additive or Multiplicative. Now the process behind this is a bit statistic heavy and I don't have enough time to explain it all but I can provide the following [ressource](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/forecast_how_it_works.htm) that may explain things further. 

Generally speaking, Tableau explains such as followed:

Additive model: Where the contributions of the model components are summed, whereas a multiplicative model is one in which at least some component contributions are multiplied. 

Multiplicative models:  Usually improves forecast quality for data where the trend or seasonality is affected by the level (magnitude) of the data.

<br>
<br>

6\. We can also change the uncertainty interval (known as the prediction interval) where decreasing our certainty will decrease the boundaries around our prediction... 

<img src="imgs/forecast10.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

7\. ...and increasing our certainty will increase the boundaries around our prediction. 

<img src="imgs/forecast11.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

### Clustering 

```{Warning} 
Just like forecasting, clustering has a lot of behind-the-scenes math going on and it's a good idea to read up on how the clustering algorithm works. 
```

Tableau Clustering uses an algorithm called K-means.

```{seealso}
 Generally speaking, explaining this algorithm can take a full lecture and, to save time, I recommend reading about it [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/a-simple-explanation-of-k-means-clustering/) or watch [the amazing lecture](https://youtu.be/tCHjHCh-5PM?t=966) by my supervisor Mike Gelbart who teaches Machine Learning at the University of British Columbia. You can find the lecture notes [here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc340/lectures/L8.pdf?raw=1).
```

Let's return to our scatterplot (that's not entirely a true scatterplot but it's acting as one).

One of the things you'll notice is that the **Cluster** option is not available. 

<img src="imgs/cluster1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. The first thing we must do is to turn off the aggregation measures so that we have the ability to cluster! We can do this by going to the top toolbar (the very top one) and under the **Analysis** tab, deselect the **Aggregate Measures**.

<img src="imgs/cluster2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will trigger the **Cluster** option under **Model** to become an option now. 


<img src="imgs/cluster3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. Let's now click and drag **Cluster** into the visualization pane and select **Cluster**. 

<img src="imgs/cluster4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will automatically produce clusters determined by Tableau. (Tableau uses the Calinski-Harabasz criterion to determine the default number of clusters - see more [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/clustering.htm#criteria-used-to-determine-the-optimal-number-of-clusters))

<img src="imgs/cluster5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

3\. We can change the number of clusters used by clicking the *Clusters** field that has been added in the Marks card and selecting **Edit clusters...**. 

<img src="imgs/cluster6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

4\. This will produce a popup where we can then decide for ourselves how many clusters we want. 

<img src="imgs/cluster7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

## Multiple Data Sources 

Tableau is quite handy because we are not limited to a single data source for our dashboards and worksheets.

We can connect multiple data sources and use them independently or by blending them.

Let's say you have 2 different data sources and there is at least 1 common field between them. 
We can connect them and "join" them so that a column from 1 source can be used for the same worksheet as columns from another source. 


### Relationships  

The default way to connect data sources is using relationships. 
 
Relationships are a flexible way to combine data for multi-table analysis in Tableau. They make your data source easier to define, change, and reuse instead of merging your data into a single source. 

Tableau makes this very easy since You only need to select matching fields to define a relationship. 

```{Warning} 
You'll need to make sure that the values in each column field match or at least overlap! 
```
 
Let's try adding the second data set called `local-area-boundary.geojson` located in the google drive at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_91LCrvZYm0rjGTNHdl185kRbKFqOEb/view?usp=sharing). 

These data are in a geojson file that we will use to make a choropleth map shortly. 

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. First, let's add a new data source. We can do this in 2 ways; either clicking the icon at the top or clicking the **Data Source** tab at the bottom where we create new worksheets and dashboards.

<img src="imgs/relations1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>



2\. Find your file and connect as you would with any data source. 

<img src="imgs/relations2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will load in our data!

<img src="imgs/relations4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

If we click on the icon shown, it will produce a dropdown and show us our 2 data sources; `street-trees` and `local-area-boundary`.

<img src="imgs/relations5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

3\. If we relocate ourselves to a new sheet, we will then see 2 data source options under the data tab in the menu on the left of our workspace. 

<img src="imgs/relations6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

4\. If we look at our new data source, you'll recognize that the `Name` column contains the same values as our `Neighbourhood Name` field in our `street-trees` data, so let's connect the two sources by this field! 

<img src="imgs/relations7.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

5\. To do so we need to click on the Data tab in the upmost menu bar and select **Edit Blend Relationships...**

<img src="imgs/relations8.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

6\. We need to customize our relationship so we click **Custom** from the popup that is generated. 

<img src="imgs/relations9.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

7\. We then select the `Neighbourhood Name` field from the first data source and the `Name` field from the second followed by **OK**.

<img src="imgs/relations10.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

8\. We confirm our Blend Relationship by clicking **OK**. 

<img src="imgs/relations11.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

9\. One thing you should notice is next to the field that we are using as a link between the data sources there is a red chain icon.  

Now let's try and use 2 data sources together. Here I'm going to try to use `Curb` from `Street-trees` and `Name` from `local-area-boundary`. 

<img src="imgs/relations12.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

What's going on though? It's saying Null for Curb values! 

10\. If we look at the 2 fields separately, you'll notice that the `Neighbourhood Name` column has values that are all in capitals letters and our `Name` column from our `local-area-boundary` data have values in a title-case style. 

<img src="imgs/relations13.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

<img src="imgs/relations14.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

We can change this by engineering a new column from the `Name` column of `local-area-boundary` where all the values are capitals!


#### Making our first Calculation 

We can engineer a new field/column using the calculation option! 

```{important}
1\. Let's first click on the `Name` field from the `local-area-boundary` data source and under the menu option **Create**, select **Calculated Field...**

<img src="imgs/calc1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. We can edit the name of this calculation to `Neighbourhood Upper` and then using the `UPPER()` function convert the `[Name]` column within it, to convert its values to uppercase. 

Note that in Tableau, column fields are identified by the name of the field in square brackets (`[]`). 

<img src="imgs/calc2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

3\. Tableau will then produce the new field with the name we specified and if we look at it, all the values will be in uppercase, just like we asked. 

<img src="imgs/calc3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

```

Let's continue to join our sources but this time we will use the correct `Neighbourhood Upper` column instead of `Name` for the `local-area-boundary` data source.

11\. Click on the **Data** tab in the upper toolbar and select **Edit Blend Relationships..** like we did before. 

<img src="imgs/relations15.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

12\. Edit the existing connection.

<img src="imgs/relations17.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

17\. Here we can select `Neighbourhood Upper` instead of `Name` for the secondary data source and click **OK**. 

<img src="imgs/relations18.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

18\. We once again confirm our links between data sources. 

<img src="imgs/relations19.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

19\. Now when we try to combine the `Curb` column from the `street-trees` data source with the `Neighbourhood Upper` column from the `local-area-boundary` data source, we can see that they are linked and no longer produce a null row like before! 

<img src="imgs/relations22.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

### Joins 

Most people who work with data will be familiar with the need to wrangle the data together and connect them using something called a join. Generally speaking, relationships are much better and convenient to use and most of the time we will not need to use a hard joining method. 

Tableau also suggests that if you need to do multiple joins while cleaning up column names and data types, it may be better to use Tableau Prep Builder. 

That all being said here are some ways you can join your data if you really need to. 

#### Types of joins 

<table class="table--plain"><colgroup><col style="width: 10%;"> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1" style="font-weight: bold;">Join Type</td> <td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1" style="font-weight: bold;">Explanation</td></tr> <tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p> Inner</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/join_type_inner.png"></p></td> <td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>Using an inner join to combine tables will result in a data source that only contains rows that are present in both tables. Any rows that are present in a single table gets thrown out.</p></td></tr> <tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p> Left</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/join_type_left.png"></p></td> <td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>Joining tables using a left join will create a table that contains all rows from the left table and corresponding matches from the right table. Any rows only present in the right table are thrown out. Any rows that are present in the left table and not in the right will produce NA values for any corresponding columns obtain from the right column.</p></td></tr> <tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p> Right </p> <p><img alt="" src="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/join_type_right.png"></p></td> <td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>This produces similar results to the Left join, however this time any rows not present in the right table now are thrown out and all the rows from the right table are kept. </p></td></tr> <tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p> Full outer</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/join_type_fullouter.png"></p></td> <td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>A full outer join will keep all rows no matter if they match or not from both tables. When a row from either table doesn't have a match with the other table, NA values will be displayed.</p></td></tr> <tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyB-Column1-Body1"><i>Union</i> <p><img alt="" src="https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/Img/join_type_union.png"></p></td> <td class="TableStyle-Basic-Border-BodyB-Column1-Body1"><p>Unions are used to stack data on top of each other. This works best if the columns in both tables are identical. See <a href="union.htm" xrefformat="{paratext}" class="MCXref xref">Union Your Data</a> for more information regarding this.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Creating a Join

**Step by Step Instructions**

1\. Let's add a new data source.  Click the icon at the top toolbar that specifies **New Data Source**.

<img src="imgs/join1.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

2\. Let's first bring in our `street-trees.csv` data file.

<img src="imgs/join2.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

3\. It's a good idea to name this something to distinguish it from the other sources so let's call it `street-trees-joined`. 

<img src="imgs/join3.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

4\. Time to bring in our `local-area-boundary` data source which is a **Spatial file**. 

<img src="imgs/join4.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


<img src="imgs/join5.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>


5\. Now that we have both data sources, let's double click on the street trees icon in the middle of our workspace. 
<img src="imgs/join6.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will change the view to what it looks like in the image below. 

<img src="imgs/join8.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

6\. First clicking on the `local-area-boundary` data source, drag the table under **Files** to a space under the `street-trees` rectangle. 
<img src="imgs/join9.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

7\. This will generate a popup where we need to connect the 2 tables. For the left table, we use `Neighbourhood Name`...

<img src="imgs/join10.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

...And for the right we can create Join Calculation.

<img src="imgs/join11.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

8\. Just like we did for relationships we convert the field to `UPPER` by placing the `Name field in square brackets within `UPPER()`. 

<img src="imgs/join12.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

This will by default create an inner join! 

<img src="imgs/join13.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

9\. If we update it with the **Update Now** button, we will see all of the columns from both tables. 

<img src="imgs/join14.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

10. To change the join type, we can click the join icon and then change it by clicking the icon of the desired join we want. Here we are selecting a full join. 

<img src="imgs/join15.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br>

Now the join icon has changed! 

<img src="imgs/join16.png"  width = "85%" alt="404 image" />

<br>
<br> 

```{admonition} Tip!
:class: tip

To delete a Data Source, click on the Data tab in the uppermost toolbar and then select *Close Data Source*.
