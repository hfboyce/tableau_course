# Who: Hayley Boyce

Hi! My name is Hayley.

Welcome to Data Visualization with Tableau. Let me introduce myself a little. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from the University of Western Ontario and a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. For the last year and a half I have developed online courses for the Key Capabilities in Data Science program from UBC's Extended Learning, Lab instructed for the Master of Data Science program, contributed to an online course framework, created a Tableau seminar-workshop, and taught a Machine learning course for UBC's Sauder School of Business. 

I have worked with companies like Riversol Skincare and Freshprep making visualization and prediction tools. 

For this course, I plan to not only teach you how to use Tableau but also how to create effective visualizations using well-known theories. 

Each class will have 3 parts: 
- Theory section on how to create **effective** visualization
- Tableau section on how to use it
- Exercise to apply your skills

## A bit about my Teaching Philosophy:

Teaching professionally for the last 2 year and working as a tutor for over 8 years, I have learned that although not all student learns in the same way, there are common approaches that can be adopted so that all they not only persevere with what they are expected to learn but also somewhat, enjoy it. 

Bluntly and ineloquently, the most important approach I take to all my teaching is to keep things fun. Learning can be extremely stressful and not all topics appeal to each student. I like to put in a considerable amount of effort so that my lectures or assignment questions are relatable or attractive in some way. This mostly means that I like to keep my notes and style light. It's important not to mistaken this strategy with lack of professionalism. I believe that having fun lectures and being professional are **NOT** mutually exclusive.
