#  Lesson 3: Dashboards and EDA

This exercise will be using the data named `indian_statups.csv` that I've provided for you at [this link from the google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zIwmqngMXQCy0ScS9VxXUdcl2TA0o-gG/view?usp=sharing). 

This data was originally obtained from the [**India Startup - 2021**](https://www.kaggle.com/bhararthshiviah/indian-startups-2021?select=2021_registered_companies.csv) Kaggle dataset which has an [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. This means that I must give attribution to Bharath Shivaiah for the data and indicate the changes I have made. 

I have wrangled the data, specifically the `state` columns so that any state codes have been converted to full state names and any misspellings have been fixed and added an additional `date` column.

This also means that for my adapted data, the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license must hold. 



## Exercise 1: Loading in the data 

1\. Load in the `indian_statups.csv` in Tableau Desktop.           
- How many geographical columns are there?
- How many Measures are there?
- How many continuous columns?
- What is the range (domain) of `Authorized Capital`?
- Are there any date fields?
- How many unique values are there in `Company Type`?

2\. If you have Tableau Prep, try it out and load in the data.              
- Add a **Clean Step** so that you can look that the distributions and values of each column.
- Which `activity_description` is most prominent in the dataset?
- How many rows have over 2 billion dollars in `Paidup Capital`? 
- What percentage of the data is of private class?

## Exercise 2: Explorative Plots 

1\. Let's make a histogram for the distribution of `Paidup Capital`.              
- Change the bin size and exclude any points that are severely outlying by changing the axis range. 
- Change the bin size to something more appropriate. 
- Show a separate distribution for each `Activity Description` using the **Pages** card.

2\. Create a scatter plot of `Paidup Capital` vs `Authorized Capital`.
- Facet this scatter plot by `Category`.
- Add a linear trend line to each facet.
- Which category has a steeper plot?

3\. Create a heat map of the count of values from the columns `Company Type` and `Activity Description`. 
- Which Company Type and Activity Description has the largest count? 
- Which Company Type(s) only have companies from 2 Activities? 

4\. Create a line plot, showing the number of companies registered in 2021. Use the column `Date of Registration` 
- You can facet this row-wise by `Category` and give them independent axes by right-clicking on an axis, clicking **edit axis**, and selecting **Independent axis ranges for each row or column**.
- Do you see something wrong here? Can you explain why this may happen?
- Now try this again using `date` instead. Although this is less precise, it's more accurate and less prone to mistakes.

## Exercise 3: Questions and Visualizations 

1\. Ask 2 questions you will want to attempt to answer using visualizations.     
- Which of the 6 question types do your questions belong to?

2\. Create 2 additional plots that answer your questions above.     
- Remember these are not in the same explorative manner as you did earlier. That means you can recreate some of the plots above without the **Pages** tool or faceting. 

## Exercise 4: Blending data

1\. Connect to a new data source.      
- Load in the `states_india.geojson` *spatial file* that is located in the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mw9qKTDot-7ECGGNsWiWGPMR5_-Y65zW/view?usp=sharing). This is the geojson file needed to make the state boundaries of India. Note that this data was acquired from the [following source](https://un-mapped.carto.com/tables/states_india/public/map). 

2\. Connect the two sources by the `State` filed in the `indian_startups` data and the `St Nm` column in the `States_india` data source.   
- This will require you to **Edit Blend Relationship**. 


## Exercise 4: Choropleth

1\. Create a choropleth map that shows the **Total** `Paidup Capital` per state.          
- Which state raised the most capital?
- Is this what you expect with your knowledge of the different states? 


## Exercise 5: Creating Dashboards  

1\. Create a new Dashboard page.              
2\. Convert Dashboard **Size** to automatic.                 
3\. From the google drive, download this       [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wLpQDBJZnuqXGeyMNOvjt7f6kn0r_ayB/view?usp=sharing) and add it to your dashboard. I recommend to "fit the image" to the outline.                 
4\. Add a title for your dashboard using a text box.              
5\. Add a selection of the plots you made above but make sure to include the Choropleth graph. Not all of them must be included.                 
6\. Create 2 filters for any of the plots.               
- Adjust these filters so it works for all the plots.  

7\. Use the Choropleth map as a filter so that the other plots are adjusted based on the state(s) selected.              
- For this to work, the field (column) in both sources must be identical. 

## Exercise 6: Formatting

1\. Give all the plots that you made in this exercise appropriate titles and axis names. Change the colours to something you'd prefer.
