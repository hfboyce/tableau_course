Hi! My name is Hayley.

Welcome to Data Visualization with Tableau. Let me introduce myself a little. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from the University of Western Ontario and a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. For the last year and a half I have developed online courses for the Key Capabilities in Data Science program from UBC's Extended Learning, Lab instructed for the Master of Data Science program, contributed to an online course framework, created a Tableau seminar-workshop, and Taught a Machine learning course for UBC's Sauder School of Business. 

I have worked with companies like Riversol Skincare and Freshprep making visualization and prediction tools. 

For this course, I plan to not only teach you how to use Tableau but also how to create effective visualizations using well-known theories.
