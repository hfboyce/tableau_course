# Learning Data Visualization with Tableau 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, learners are expected to be able to:

1. Distinguish between good visualizations vs bad visualizations.
2. Explain how visualizations are important to the data analysis process. 
3. Conduct full exploratory data analysis including visualizations. 
4. Use appropriate plots and graphs to effectively communicate insights from the data with a specified audience.
5. Create a compelling narrative for your findings using storytelling.
6. Connect Tableau to different data sources.
7. Construct maps, distributions, bar and line plots using Tableau.
8. Identify the different data fields and data types used by Tableau and when to appropriately apply them to different columns.

## Class Outline

### Lesson 1 - Introduction to Tableau and Visualization Importance
#### Theory 
- Why do we visualize?  
    - tables vs graphs
    - Improvements and effectiveness

#### Tableau Applications 
- Introduce Tableau examples
- History of Tableau
- Other Tools available, pros and cons
- Where is visualization situated in the grand scheme of data science? Can visualization be an end goal?
- Connecting to csv, excel (differences)
- Connecting to SQL Server
- Introduction to data types (Ordinal, Nominal, Quantitative & continuous, discrete, binary, ordered, unordered, DateTime, text, etc.)
- Tableau buttons (show me menu, filter and marks, sorting)
- Dimensions and Measures
- Discrete vs continuous
- Worksheets vs dashboards vs story
- Quick viz examples and effectiveness 
    - Aggregate
    - Drill down, Hierarchies 
    - Maps
- Distributing and saving

#### Exercise 

- Load in the data 
- Create separate plots using worksheets 
- Change datatype
- Create a bar chart 
- Create a map
- Asking questions to explore

### Lesson 2 - Viz Types and the Tableau Dashboard

#### Theory 

- Common visualization types (bar, line, points, intervals, geo-spatial, chord, etc.)
- When do we use what?

### Tableau Applications 

- Pie chart
- Stacked bars 
- Side by side bars 
- Scatter plot 
- Line graph
- Bins - Histograms
- Boxplot
- Heatmap
- Dashboards
    - Layouts 
    - Changes to all sheets 
    - Connecting sheets 
    - Filtering 
- Publishing data sources

#### Exercise 

- Create a histograph
- Create a time series
- Heatmap 
- Add to a dashboard
- Add filters 
- Add tooltips and change the layout


### Lesson 3 - Exploratory Data Visualization, Aesthetics and Trends

#### Theory 

- Developing the 6 types of statistical questions (exploratory, descriptive, inferential {frequentist, Bayesian}, causal, mechanistic, predictive)
- Why are EDAs important?
- How to approach an EDA?
- Conclusion and next steps in an EDA  

### Tableau Applications 

- Dashboards 
- EDA
- Facetting
- Trend lines
- Forecasting 
- Calculations breifly
- unions joins, relationships.
- Chloropleth map 

#### Exercise

- Dashboard practice
- Facetting
- Calculations (briefly)
- Chloropleth
- Combine 2 dataframes

### Lesson 4 - Good vs Evil, Tableau Stories and Extras

#### Theory 

- What should you absolutely not do? Data Science Ducks
- Common pitfalls (8-10 examples)
- A game of Good vs Evil
- Best practices
- Storytelling 

### Tableau Applications 

- Tooltip
- sets, slicing
- Formatting

If time:

- Clicks and hovers  
- Palettes 
- Shapes
- Extensions  
- Navigation


## Exercise 
- Add a hover to your dashboard
- Create a palette 
- Use an additional extension 
- Create a tableau story 

Next class, take any dataset, make a mini dashboard (What is your question?) then present it in the next class. 

### Lesson 5 - Dashboard Presentations

- Present your dashboards.
- As a group discuss how each dashboard is effective and contribute potential ideas to enhance them.
